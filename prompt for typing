Create a function called `generate_typing_test_result()` that simulates the output of a Typing Master test. The function should return a detailed summary of the test result including the following components:

1. **Test ID**: A unique identifier for the test session (UUID or numeric).
2. **User Info**:
   - User ID or name (optional)
   - Typing profile (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
3. **Test Metadata**:
   - Test duration in seconds
   - Test difficulty level (easy, medium, hard, custom)
   - Text type (random words, paragraphs, code, numbers)
   - Timestamp of the test (ISO format)
4. **Typing Metrics**:
   - **Gross WPM (Words Per Minute)**: Total speed before errors
   - **Net WPM**: Final speed after subtracting penalties for errors
   - **Accuracy (%)**: Percentage of correct keystrokes
   - **Characters typed**: Total typed characters (including errors)
   - **Correct characters**: Total correctly typed characters
   - **Incorrect characters**: Number of mistyped characters
   - **Total words typed**
5. **Error Breakdown**:
   - List of most common mistakes (e.g., 'e' typed instead of 'r')
   - Repeated errors (characters with 2+ mistakes)
   - Missed words or skipped sections (if applicable)
6. **Timing Breakdown (Optional)**:
   - Average time per word
   - Fastest word
   - Slowest word
7. **Skill Feedback**:
   - Strengths (e.g., "Great accuracy, even under time pressure")
   - Weaknesses (e.g., "Frequent typing errors on punctuation")
   - Suggested improvement areas
8. **Overall Rating**:
   - A score out of 100
   - Rank or badge (e.g., "Typing Ninja", "Speed Learner")
9. **Export Options** (optional):
   - Ability to export result to PDF, JSON, or shareable link

Ensure the function is structured, consistent, and returns the data in a dictionary or structured object. The result should be suitable for display in a user interface or stored in a database.
